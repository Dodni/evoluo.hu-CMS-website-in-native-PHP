# evoluo.hu is a CMS website in native php
 It was a sprint project for applying a job IN VANILLA PHP. I had to make a CMS website for manage blogs. I was working on them 8 days and more than 100 hours without rest. THE MVC FRAMEWORK ISN'T MINE, but I'll do one by myself.
# I have to make the code nicer and clearer with more functions. I'll work on it in my freetime for hobby.
I want to make a documentation for this project and I'd write some javascrpit for make it more dinamic.
